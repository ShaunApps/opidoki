## Synopsis
This rails app is intended to provide a slick gui for broadcasting truth, onto 
the Bitcoin blockchain with Counterparty. "Truth" is determined by opening web 
browser and a url, at a defined time, and executing supplied javascript (or a 
regex) against the loaded page. The return value (or true/false) is broadcast 
onto the network and is then available for use for resolving smart contracts, 
or bets. Once defined in opidoki, can be matched by anyone with a Counterparty 
wallet, via the Counterparty GUI. It's conceivable that in the future, simple 
counterparty url schemes could be provided to provide one-click decentralized 
financial positions.

The opidoki server itself has no 'knowledge' or culpability for the outcomes of 
it's broadcasts for all the same reasons that the pages it reads have no 
culpability. By utilizing the Counterparty and Bitcoin networks, counterparty 
risk for all participants is nil, and regulatory encumbrances are unenforceable, 
and moot.

##Party On!
